Configuration Files
===================

My custom config files and rcs.

Installation
------------

Inside the repository you can run `install.sh` to place the configs in `~`.
This will symlink them from the repository, so you can easily update with `git
pull`.

This also does some basic setup that you may or may not want, ie `bics` and
`vim-pathogen` are setup, as well some defaults for Mac OS X
